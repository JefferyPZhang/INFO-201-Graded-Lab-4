# INFO 201 Graded Lab: File System and Path

1 File system tree
1. Draw the file system tree of your own computer. Do this on paper. You can take a picture of it
and include in your answer.
2. On the tree, mark
(a) the folder where you keep your info201 materials
(b) a few images in your Pictures folder. (Pick another folder where you have pictures if you
do not have a dedicated Pictures folder.)
(c) The path of how to get from your info201 folder to one of the images your selected. (You
can use arrows to mark it.)
3. Write the long-form directions for accessing one of the images in your picture folder from your
info201 folder.
4. Write the same directions in short form.

2 Working directory and absolute path
1. Start R in the place where you normally do your info201 labs.
What is the working directory of your running R?
2. Draw the file system tree, starting from the root directory, down to your current working direc-
tory. At each branch, mark the way to the working directory, and mark also at least one other
folder (or file).
3. Write down the absolute path as directions in the long and in the short form to the current
working directory.
3 Display images
1. Start R in a place where you normally do your info201 stuff.
2. Pick one image in your Pictures folder (or somewhere else if you do not have Pictures). Write
out the relative path from where you are to that image. You can just use Râ€™s notation, but if
that is complicated, you can also start with the long form and short form before that.
3. Use magick library to display that image in RStudio.
Hint: see The course book 9.2.2
4. Pick a pdf file in your Documents folder (or somewhere else if you do not have Documents).
5. Write out the absolute path of that document.
6. Use the magick library to display that in RStudio.
